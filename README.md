# Sheet-Divider
This Google Colab script enables users to split a single large CSV file into multiple smaller CSV files. The script prompts the user to upload their CSV file, specify the number of parts to split it into, and then automatically downloads the resulting smaller CSV files. Each smaller CSV file retains the header row from the original file.
